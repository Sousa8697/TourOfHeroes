# Tour of Heroes

This project was built to display my knowledge of Angular for Boyle Transportation. I did not have a good amount of time to work on this project and add additional features that I would have liked to but I did try to replicate it as closesly as possible. I did add unit tests for testing purposes, if you would like to see those, you can access them in any of the component.spec.ts files. Lastly I used an in memory solution to retrieving, storing, and manipulating data.

## Development server

Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `npm run-script build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `npm test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
